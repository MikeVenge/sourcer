> “Move Fast and Break Things” vs “Move Slow and Forge Things”

“Move fast and break things” was a something we invented at Facebook to get a bunch of entitled Ivy League kids to grind for us. It worked. 

Then, all of Silicon Valley mistakenly confused correlation with causation and adopted this mode for themselves without questioning it. 

In a world of AI, those that continue to pray at this altar will be the first to lose their jobs. 

Moving fast and breaking things is exactly the low hanging fruit that AI will automate. 

Learn to move slow and forge things.  Make things that can stand the test of time. Learn discipline and process and you’ll have a job forever.

> to be clear, i am not opining on the general short positions @michaeljburry has taken in AI tech… my commentary was strictly regarding the thesis that 6 year depreciation on data center infrastructure was artificially boosting earnings. there are obvious and important questions afoot regarding round tripping capital into revenue, contractual commitments that aren’t really committed, off balance sheet debt instruments, inflated valuation multiples, unsustainable capex exposure, and so on. burry is very thoughtful and his broader short thesis may be well-timed. but i’m not sure depreciation schedules are the pin that will pop any bubbles…

> Of course that is your contention. You’re a first-year AI skeptic. You just finished reading Andrew Ross Sorkin’s 1929 and now you think we’re reliving the Roaring Twenties with GPUs. You will cling to that until next month when you hear Jim Chanos talk about “unsustainable capex,” and then you will start parroting that the entire AI ecosystem is about to collapse under the weight of its own spending. That will last until someone posts a CoreWeave CDS chart and you’ll repeat that too without realizing it was just dealers hedging credit portfolios, not some cosmic warning sign.

Then you’ll probably start lecturing people about Global Crossing because you heard someone say “1999 fiber bubble” and it made you feel informed.

Meanwhile Nvidia just printed one of the biggest sequential growth quarters the sector has ever seen and guided higher again. The workloads are real, the demand is real, and the capex is already contractually locked. None of that came from a crash-narrative paperback or a Chanos soundbite.

But sure. Keep borrowing other people’s takes and pretending they are your own. One day you might look at the actual numbers and realize this is not a bubble. It is the early stage of the largest infrastructure buildout in decades.

**Content:**
> What I read this week...

1) @Google announced Gemini 3 on November 18, 2025, calling it its “most intelligent” model to date and rolling it out day-one across Search (AI Mode), the Gemini app, AI Studio, Vertex AI, and a new agentic dev environment called Google Antigravity.

It has topped the charts on:
- LMArena Leaderboard with a breakthrough score right above Grok’s 4.1 release
- Humanity’s Last Exam with PhD-level reasoning
- GPQA Diamond (for scientific knowledge)

And leading many more benchmarks, showing that scaling laws are still intact.

The key insight is that multiple sources, including model cards and press coverage, confirm that Gemini 3 Pro was trained on Google’s own Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), not Nvidia GPUs. This gives Google a strong advantage over other firms that are in extreme competition for processing units.

Nano Banana has also been upgraded to a Pro version and is Google’s advanced image generation and editing tool. It introduces 4K output, real-time iterative refinement, and hybrid JSON prompting for complex scenes, at roughly a 4x speedup over prior Nano Banana generations. The additional speed and quality is attributed explicitly to optimized tensor processing on TPUs.

> 3) @tryramp announced their raise of $300M at a $32B valuation led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Their revenue doubled to over $1B in one year with a 153% YoY growth rate, 10x faster than the median public SaaS business.

Their massive move has been on the back of their new AI initiative. Ramp’s AI has made over 26 million decisions across $10 billion in spend to create “thinking money”, auditing itself with intelligence, memory and reason. By automating the obvious key decisions, this leaves room for the finance team to make higher-leverage decisions.

Ramp is now positioning itself as a full-stack finance operations platform. Modules now cover cards, expense management, bill payments, procurement, travel, and analytics, all powered by automation. Their core pitch: The median customer that Ramp serves is able to save 5% while growing revenue 12% YoY, running on leaner teams with faster closing times on the books.

> Which AI Products Will Have Churn vs. Not?

“The number one predictor of retention is the number of integrations.

If it's easy to rip it out, you will rip it out. If it's cheaper, and if it's hard to rip it out, you won't bother.

If you're just a database of prompts and interchangeable, it's a big sign saying, cut me now when you have to save $80K.

But if you're integrated to five things and you're like, oh my God, we'll have to talk to it… then screw it."

How do you think about what can be done to retain but also not become a pure database with all engagement and interactions belonging to front facing agents? @dharmesh @nicolasosharp @keithpeiris

1. Of every $$ a vibe coding platform makes, what % goes to Anthropic?
2. How does the margin change when switching between models?
3. Do vibe coding platforms really have any defensibility… really?
4. Does Cursor and Cognition come down to eat consumer or do consumer platforms like Lovable, Replit and Base44 move up and eat more of the dev workflow?
5. Salesforce, Atlassian, Cloudflare, of all incumbents adding vibe coding, which is best and worst?

> Look at the price action since the AI jitters on 11/10, the market is clearly assigning a “stability premium” to the names with the biggest contracted HPC bases, not the best risk–reward.

$CORZ – 590 MW contracted and fast-to-scale BTC shells, so it trades like the safest.
$WULF – 594 MW contracted on real zero-carbon power, so it gets treated as stable.
$CIFR – 600 MW contracted, but ERCOT buildout risk keeps it in the middle.
$APLD – 600 MW contracted but with execution/infra dependencies, so it stays discounted.
$IREN – 310 MW contracted and multi-year hyperscale builds, so slower to re-rate.
$WYFI – only 16 MW contracted today, so it gets punished the most…but has the most torque if even one large HPC deal lands.

Same sector, completely different convexity profiles.
