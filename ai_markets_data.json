Non-violent actions, such as warning shots or missile launches that land in territorial waters or pass through airspace, will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. Intentional ship ramming that results in significant damage to (e.g., a hole in the hull) or the sinking of a military ship by another will count toward a \"Yes\" resolution; however, minor damage (scrapes, dents) will not. \n\nAny U.S. military kinetic strike that impacts Venezuelan land territory will qualify for a \u201cYes\u201d resolution.\n\nMissiles or drone strikes which are intercepted will not qualify regardless of whether they land on adversarial territory or cause damage. Similarly, surface-to-air missile strikes impacting adversarial territory will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution (although surface to air missiles fired at an adversarial military aircraft would qualify).\n\nNote: the U.S. Coast Guard is a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces; Venezuela\u2019s Milicia Nacional Bolivariana (militia) is a \u201cspecial component\u201d of the Venezuelan National Bolivarian Armed Forces (FANB); and Venezuela\u2019s Coast Guard (Comando de Guardacostas) is a component of the Venezuelan Navy (Armada Bolivariana) and thus part of the FANB.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.",

    "description": "The 2025 Dutch general election is scheduled to take place on October 29, 2025.\n\nThis market will resolve to the first ruling coalition of parties that forms after the 2025 Dutch general election.\n\nIf the next Dutch Government after the election is not announced by October 31, 2026, this market will resolve to \"No Coalition by October 31\".\n\nA party will only be considered part of the coalition if it signs the coalition agreement and provides at least one cabinet minister.\n\nThis market may resolve once the first government is officially announced and sworn in by the monarch, with ministers appointed under non-caretaker circumstances.\n\nThe following parties will be to be considered for this market: PVV, GroenLinks\u2013PvdA, VVD, CDA, D66, JA21. All other parties (including but not limited to SP, BBB, NSC, DENK, PvdD, FvD, SGP, CU, and Volt) will not be considered. \n\nResolution will be based on the listed option that most completely matches the parties included. If the coalition formed after the election includes all of the parties listed in a market option (along with any other parties), that option will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d unless there exists another market option that more completely covers the coalition.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf the governing coalition includes GL\u2013PvdA + VVD + CDA + JA21, but no option explicitly lists those four together, the market will resolve to \u201cVVD + CDA + JA21\u201d.\n\nIf the governing coalition includes PVV + VVD + CDA + D66, the option \u201cPVV + VVD + CDA + D66\u201d will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, while \u201cPVV + VVD + CDA\u201d will resolve to \u201cNo\".\n\nIf the governing coalition does not match any listed option (e.g. the governing coalition is D66 + JA21) this market will resolve to \u201cOther\u201d. \n\nIn the event that multiple market options each contain an equal number of coalition parties, the tie will be resolved in favor of the option whose listed parties together hold the greater number of seats in the newly elected House of Representatives. If this presents another tie, this market will resolve in favor of the listed coalition which received the greater number of valid votes.\n\nThis market will resolve based on a consensus of credible reporting. In case of ambiguity, this market will resolve based on official information from the Government of the Netherlands.",

All other parties (including but not limited to SP, BBB, NSC, DENK, PvdD, FvD, SGP, CU, and Volt) will not be considered. \n\nResolution will be based on the listed option that most completely matches the parties included.

        "description": "The 2025 Dutch general election is scheduled to take place on October 29, 2025.\n\nThis market will resolve to the first ruling coalition of parties that forms after the 2025 Dutch general election.\n\nIf the next Dutch Government after the election is not announced by October 31, 2026, this market will resolve to \"No Coalition by October 31\".\n\nA party will only be considered part of the coalition if it signs the coalition agreement and provides at least one cabinet minister.\n\nThis market may resolve once the first government is officially announced and sworn in by the monarch, with ministers appointed under non-caretaker circumstances.\n\nThe following parties will be to be considered for this market: PVV, GroenLinks\u2013PvdA, VVD, CDA, D66, JA21. All other parties (including but not limited to SP, BBB, NSC, DENK, PvdD, FvD, SGP, CU, and Volt) will not be considered. \n\nResolution will be based on the listed option that most completely matches the parties included. If the coalition formed after the election includes all of the parties listed in a market option (along with any other parties), that option will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d unless there exists another market option that more completely covers the coalition.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf the governing coalition includes GL\u2013PvdA + VVD + CDA + JA21, but no option explicitly lists those four together, the market will resolve to \u201cVVD + CDA + JA21\u201d.\n\nIf the governing coalition includes PVV + VVD + CDA + D66, the option \u201cPVV + VVD + CDA + D66\u201d will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, while \u201cPVV + VVD + CDA\u201d will resolve to \u201cNo\".\n\nIf the governing coalition does not match any listed option (e.g. the governing coalition is D66 + JA21) this market will resolve to \u201cOther\u201d. \n\nIn the event that multiple market options each contain an equal number of coalition parties, the tie will be resolved in favor of the option whose listed parties together hold the greater number of seats in the newly elected House of Representatives. If this presents another tie, this market will resolve in favor of the listed coalition which received the greater number of valid votes.\n\nThis market will resolve based on a consensus of credible reporting. In case of ambiguity, this market will resolve based on official information from the Government of the Netherlands.",
