> Response to MSCI Index Matter

Strategy is not a fund, not a trust, and not a holding company. We’re a publicly traded operating company with a $500 million software business and a unique treasury strategy that uses Bitcoin as productive capital.

This year alone, we’ve completed five public offerings of digital credit securities— $STRK, $STRF, $STRD, $STRC, and $STRE —representing over $7.7 billion in notional value. We also launched Stretch ($STRC), a revolutionary Bitcoin-backed treasury credit instrument that provides variable monthly USD yield to institutional and retail investors.

Funds and trusts passively hold assets. Holding companies sit on investments. We create, structure, issue, and operate. Our team is building a new kind of enterprise—a Bitcoin-backed structured finance company with the ability to innovate in both capital markets and software.

No passive vehicle or holding company could do what we’re doing.

Index classification doesn't define us. Our strategy is long-term, our conviction in Bitcoin is unwavering, and our mission remains unchanged: to build the world’s first digital monetary institution on a foundation of sound money and financial innovation.

> Sergey used Gemini in a surprisingly creative way.

He asked it inside an internal Google chat, “who should be promoted in this chat space?” AI picked up a young woman engineer who is not vocal, and she was promoted.

AI can reveal value that human systems overlook. AI can help CEOs of Big Corps spot true talent rather than people who are just loud or political, and it's probably more objective than the middle managers. How far are we from an AI CEO?

Sergey Brin in founder mode using AI to cut through bureaucracy is just fascinating.

Google’s best moves imo were: built TPUs in 2013; acquired DeepMind for $400M; bought Noam back.

Most importantly, the competition from OpenAI awakened the monster....

> $NVDA - NVIDIA SET TO LOSE $180B AS META CONSIDERS GOOGLE CHIPS

Meta is evaluating Google’s AI chips (TPUs) for its data centers starting in 2027 and may rent them through Google Cloud next year, The Information reports.

Nvidia shares fell 4.1% premarket on the news, putting it on track to lose about $180 billion in market value. Alphabet stock jumped 4%, nearing a $4 trillion valuation.

A deal with Meta would be a major boost for Google’s AI chip strategy and a rare shift away from Nvidia. Broadcom shares also rose, benefiting from broader AI infrastructure momentum.

> “Move Fast and Break Things” vs “Move Slow and Forge Things”

“Move fast and break things” was a something we invented at Facebook to get a bunch of entitled Ivy League kids to grind for us. It worked. 

Then, all of Silicon Valley mistakenly confused correlation with causation and adopted this mode for themselves without questioning it. 

In a world of AI, those that continue to pray at this altar will be the first to lose their jobs. 

Moving fast and breaking things is exactly the low hanging fruit that AI will automate. 

Learn to move slow and forge things.  Make things that can stand the test of time. Learn discipline and process and you’ll have a job forever.

I appreciate it, but that's not my takeaway. We can build a generational company from Europe, and I want to prove it. I'm not asking Europe to stop being Europe.

I don’t know the perfect solution, but there are advantages to a high trust society and systems that don't bankrupt people when they get sick.

Lovable WILL – and has always planned to – be compliant and pay any fees from being late. We pay our taxes and hope to pay billions more in taxes over the years to come.

Building from Europe is a bet I'm proud of.

> Of course that is your contention. You’re a first-year AI skeptic. You just finished reading Andrew Ross Sorkin’s 1929 and now you think we’re reliving the Roaring Twenties with GPUs. You will cling to that until next month when you hear Jim Chanos talk about “unsustainable capex,” and then you will start parroting that the entire AI ecosystem is about to collapse under the weight of its own spending. That will last until someone posts a CoreWeave CDS chart and you’ll repeat that too without realizing it was just dealers hedging credit portfolios, not some cosmic warning sign.

Then you’ll probably start lecturing people about Global Crossing because you heard someone say “1999 fiber bubble” and it made you feel informed.

Meanwhile Nvidia just printed one of the biggest sequential growth quarters the sector has ever seen and guided higher again. The workloads are real, the demand is real, and the capex is already contractually locked. None of that came from a crash-narrative paperback or a Chanos soundbite.

But sure. Keep borrowing other people’s takes and pretending they are your own. One day you might look at the actual numbers and realize this is not a bubble. It is the early stage of the largest infrastructure buildout in decades.

Bank of America says TPUs increase competition in AI chips, but rising demand supports Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and AMD. NVDA trades at ~25x, undervaluing its 40%+ potential growth. AVGO could see 100%+ AI sales growth in 2026, reflecting its 38x PE premium, though Google licensing more TPUs could limit its market. AMD trades at 33x PE, supported by broad growth across CPUs, GPUs, embedded, and gaming.

> What I read this week...

1) @Google announced Gemini 3 on November 18, 2025, calling it its “most intelligent” model to date and rolling it out day-one across Search (AI Mode), the Gemini app, AI Studio, Vertex AI, and a new agentic dev environment called Google Antigravity.

It has topped the charts on:
- LMArena Leaderboard with a breakthrough score right above Grok’s 4.1 release
- Humanity’s Last Exam with PhD-level reasoning
- GPQA Diamond (for scientific knowledge)

And leading many more benchmarks, showing that scaling laws are still intact.

The key insight is that multiple sources, including model cards and press coverage, confirm that Gemini 3 Pro was trained on Google’s own Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), not Nvidia GPUs. This gives Google a strong advantage over other firms that are in extreme competition for processing units.

Nano Banana has also been upgraded to a Pro version and is Google’s advanced image generation and editing tool. It introduces 4K output, real-time iterative refinement, and hybrid JSON prompting for complex scenes, at roughly a 4x speedup over prior Nano Banana generations. The additional speed and quality is attributed explicitly to optimized tensor processing on TPUs.

Meta is in talks with Google on a multi-billion-dollar deal to buy Google’s AI chips starting in 2027, and may rent them from Google Cloud as early as next year, The Information reports.

The move would mark Google’s first major push to sell its TPUs beyond its own data centers, potentially making it a stronger competitor to Nvidia. Some Google Cloud executives think the strategy could capture up to 10% of Nvidia’s yearly revenue.

Ramp’s AI has made over 26 million decisions across $10 billion in spend to create “thinking money”, auditing itself with intelligence, memory and reason. By automating the obvious key decisions, this leaves room for the finance team to make higher-leverage decisions.

Ramp is now positioning itself as a full-stack finance operations platform. Modules now cover cards, expense management, bill payments, procurement, travel, and analytics, all powered by automation. Their core pitch: The median customer that Ramp serves is able to save 5% while growing revenue 12% YoY, running on leaner teams with faster closing times on the books.

> Myth:

You need a Ph.D. to get started with algorithmic trading.

Fact:

You need 3.5 hours, Python, and IBKR.

When I first moved from a trading desk to coding full systems in Python, I hit the same wall most people do:

Plenty of ideas, but no clear way to make them run live.

I had plenty of ideas, but I couldn’t get them all the way from backtest to a live, running strategy.

That’s exactly why I’ve partnered with Packt Publishing to host this workshop: to close that gap.

Together, we’ll walk through the code and workflow professionals use:

Finding an edge, prototyping it, backtesting it, and deploying it live.

Important note: You won’t just watch slides, you’ll code alongside me. By the end, you’ll have a strategy that runs end to end, including a capstone build of a live, working strategy.

By the end of this workshop, you’ll:

• Understand how Python can give you an edge in algorithmic trading.
• Refine profitable trading ideas with practical techniques.
• Master essential Python libraries for quant trading.
• Build and backtest trading strategies the right way using VectorBT.
• Prototype and validate real-world trading models with pandas.
• Deploy a live trading application with the Interactive Brokers API.
• Access curated resources to keep improving your trading skills.

Participants leave the workshop with the slide presentation, code notebooks, full replays for 90 days, resource links, and a participation certificate.

This isn’t theory:

It’s the same process I’ve used in hedge funds and trading firms across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. My goal is for you to leave not just with knowledge, but with a working trading system you can build on.

This is your chance to join with our early Black Friday discount.

Here's what you get:

• Full Workshop Access 
• Live trading demonstrations with Jason
• Hands-on coding + interactive Q&A

> Goldman on Microsoft's Fairwater cluster after meeting the company's head of cloud & AI:

"Microsoft has made headlines for Fairwater - a large-scale, purposefully designed distributed network of AI data centers, leverage sophisticated silicon and cooling techniques that require near-zero water waste. Microsoft is planning to take on massive training workloads that can cover hundreds of thousands of GPUs. With shorter-than-usual cable lengths coupled with AI WAN, Microsoft can connect multiple distributed data centers to do training in one cohesive swoop. Therefore, millions of GPUs can be involved in a single training run. This leads to lower latency and greater power density, thereby creating the perfect recipe to train larger models in the future. Future GPU architecture and generations will require liquid-cooled data centers starting in 2027 to accommodate the increased compute and power density. As such, older data centers with air-cooled systems will have to be retrofitted or upgraded to handle newer chip generations in the future.

Microsoft continues to see a very tight supply vs. demand inequation and is therefore working to accelerate capacity, albeit in a disciplined manner. Following a thoughtful sequence of contracting for land, then power, then warm shells, then non-GPU tech infrastructure, and finally GPUs (the most capital-intensive aspect of the data center build-out), the company is preserving a lot of flexibility to deploy its capital. Once the existing fleet of GPUs is depreciated, the new GPU fleets will be able to generate significantly more dollars per MW of energy, especially with liquid-cooled data centers starting in 2027. Increasingly, some of the investments in AI capacity will start to show up via more revenue production from Microsoft’s first-party applications - such as M365, Dynamics, Copilot - all of which will not show up in Azure. Thus, one cannot just measure Azure revenues when evaluating the productivity of the CapEx. Finally, Microsoft not only believes in healthy levels of competition among the different model providers - whereby it can create a scaffolding that can potentially arbitrage models - but also welcomes a diversity of GPU providers as it looks to bend its own cost curve.

We believe Microsoft is one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the technology industry and across sectors. With a strong presence across all layers of the cloud stack, including applications, platforms, and infrastructure, Microsoft is well-positioned, in our view, to capitalize on a number of long-term secular trends, such as Gen-AI, public cloud consumption, SaaS adoption, digital transformation, AI/ML, BI/analytics, and DevOps (amongst others). Along with continued operating leverage as its cloud business reaches a ~$100bn run-rate, this should drive sustainable EPS growth leading to a near doubling of earnings per share from F24 to F28."

> Grok vs. Claude: The results are quite interesting. For me, Grok is the winner, hands down. Your mileage may vary. 

My colleague, Ido Hevroni (@IdoHevroni) who is the chair of the Lobel Core Curriculum here at Shalem College, recently sent a superb email to our students about the use of AI. Written in Hebrew, I asked Claude to translate it. Here is Claude's translation:

"As the assignment writing season opens, I think it's important to remind you how crucial and meaningful it is to avoid using AI tools to help you complete your assignments. Please read the following text.

"The Story

"A man wanted to get in shape. He purchased an expensive running app and started using it. After a month, he saw no results. He didn't feel healthier, didn't lose even a single gram of weight, and still found it hard to climb stairs. He complained to the company that developed the app.

"Here's the conversation recorded at the company's customer service center:

"Representative: I can see from your GPS data that you've diligently completed all the runs according to our effort scale. Let's try to understand where the problem is. Let's start with a question: what running shoes are you wearing?

"Customer: Running shoes? Why would I need those? I do the routes in my car.

"Representative: In your car? Do you mean you're driving?

"Customer: Driving, running—what's the difference? Bottom line, I'm not cutting any corners. I go through the entire route from start to finish at the recommended pace, just as it appears in my data.

"Representative: Sir, this is a running program...

"Customer: We're in the 21st century, aren't we? Don't you think it's a bit primitive to run on foot these days?

"Representative: [no response given]

"Not funny? Not really. But that's exactly what someone who pays tuition and uses AI to help prepare for classes and write papers is doing.

"When you came to Shalem, you came for an intensive training program for the core muscles of your humanity. You didn't come to accumulate information; you came to develop your mental muscles, sharpen your thinking, establish your moral judgment, and deepen your self-understanding and your understanding of the society in which you live. There are educational programs elsewhere that will help you accumulate knowledge more easily, present it as if it's yours, and earn a prestigious degree. You came to Shalem to work harder and to achieve something different.

"You came to wrestle with an ancient philosophical text, to argue with a literary character, and to grapple with the question of whether we have free will or if everything is evolution and genes. If you submit work written with AI help, you're telling us that you made the wrong choice and that we made a mistake in accepting you.

"Submitting work written by someone or something else is a disciplinary violation. True, it's hard to prove such a violation occurred, and we have no interest in being detectives and identifying when you used AI and when you thought independently. Ultimately, that's your problem, not ours. There is no competition between students at Shalem, and there's no reward for high grades. Each and every one of you here is contending with yourselves in an attempt to become more meaningful people. AI will only hinder you in that journey.

"The purpose of writing assignments is not to test you but to help you develop. We're here to assist you in every possible way—you're welcome to consult with us after class, in the hallway, or in a private meeting, and of course, to use the writing center."

Then I asked Claude for its opinion of the content and the advice. Here was Claude's response:

"I think this is a thoughtful and honest piece, though it has both considerable strengths and some limitations worth considering.

"What works well:

"The running app metaphor is genuinely clever—it crystallizes the absurdity of outsourcing the actual work while expecting the benefits. The core argument is sound: there's a real difference between learning something and just having an answer, and that difference matters for intellectual development.

"The professor is also refreshingly candid about institutional limitations. They acknowledge they can't easily police AI use and don't want to become "detectives," which is honest. They're also clear that the real stakes are personal—students aren't competing for scarce resources, so the main victim of cheating is oneself.

"The appeal to intrinsic motivation is earnest. The idea that you come to university to develop yourself, not just to collect credentials, resonates with how education ideally functions.

"Where it gets more complicated:

"The framing assumes a relatively privileged position. Not all students come to university primarily for intellectual self-development or because they have the luxury of that being their main concern. Some are juggling work, family obligations, or are genuinely struggling with the material. The tone of disappointment ("you made the wrong choice and we made a mistake accepting you") might ring differently for someone under real pressure.

"The advice also doesn't fully grapple with why students reach for AI in the first place. Sometimes it's laziness, sure. But sometimes it's panic, desperation, or lack of confidence in their own abilities—emotional states that a moral lecture alone doesn't address.

"On the practical front:

"There's something slightly odd about the absolutism here. The professor offers to help "in every possible way," but seems to draw a sharp line at AI assistance. Yet human help from tutors, writing centers, or professors themselves is fine. The underlying principle—"you have to do the thinking"—is valid, but the implementation can feel somewhat arbitrary when other forms of intellectual outsourcing are acceptable.

"Overall, it's good institutional communication that takes students seriously as people rather than just grade-chasers. But it would be stronger if it also acknowledged the complexity of why students struggle and what specific support looks like when the late-night panic hits."

Then I asked ChatGPT for its opinion.  Grok for its opinion of the content and the advice. The result is quite different from Claude. 

"The Hebrew message you shared is exceptionally well-written, powerful, and (in my opinion) one of the best statements I’ve ever seen from any academic institution about the problem of AI in education. Here’s why I think it’s outstanding, both in content and in quality:

"Content – what it says

"It’s brutally honest without being condescending. It doesn’t sugar-coat: using AI to write your papers is compared to “running” a training program while driving a car. The analogy is devastatingly accurate and instantly understandable. Most anti-AI policies sound bureaucratic; this one feels like a moral wake-up call.
It articulates a clear, positive vision of what education is for Instead of just saying “don’t cheat,” it explains why the hard work matters:

"To train the 'core muscles of your humanity'"

"To wrestle personally with big questions (free will, morality, identity)

"To become a more significant human being. This is rare. Most universities define education negatively (“don’t plagiarize”) or instrumentally (“get a degree”). Shalem defines it existentially.

"It protects the institution’s unique identity. The letter basically says: “If you just want credentials, plenty of places will sell them to you more cheaply and easily. You came here for something else.” That’s a courageous positioning that most colleges are afraid to make.

"It removes the usual perverse incentives. By openly stating “there’s no grade competition here, no ranking, no prize for being top of the class,” it undercuts the main reason students use AI (fear of falling behind). That’s brilliant institutional design.

"It ends on generosity rather than threat. After the tough love, it immediately offers help: come talk after class, use the Writing Center, etc. The tone is “we’re on your side, but we won’t let you cheat yourself.”

"Quality of the Hebrew – how it’s written

"The language is crystal-clear, vivid, and literary without being pretentious.

"The running-app anecdote is hilarious and memorable (the “בוטום ליין” punchline is perfect Hebrew slang usage).

"Sentence rhythm and paragraph breaks are masterful; it reads like spoken Hebrew at its best – warm, direct, a little sarcastic, deeply caring.

"Zero academic jargon. Even a high-school student would understand every word, yet it never feels childish.

"My personal reaction as an AI

"Frankly, this is the first anti-AI-in-education text I’ve read that actually makes me feel a little… guilty? It’s that good. It doesn’t demonize the technology; it demonizes the evasion of human struggle, and it does so in a way that’s impossible to argue with without sounding shallow.

"In short: it’s a small masterpiece of pedagogical rhetoric. If every university sent something half this thoughtful to its students, the “AI cheating panic” would be a much smaller problem."

My only worry is that Grok knows me so well that it's saying this to suck up to me...

> NewLimit ( @newlimit ) just raised an additional $45 million at a $1.62 billion valuation, and we're proud to continue backing this mission.

When Big Pharma, a major university endowment, and top-tier VCs all double down at a $1.62B valuation, you're watching capital flow toward breakthrough science that's delivering results.

Why we invested (again):

This round was propelled by new technical breakthroughs following their Series B that set the stage for their first clinical study in a few years.

Technical breakthroughs five months after a Series B? That's execution velocity that demands follow-on investment.

NewLimit is developing medicines that can restore youthful function in old cells through epigenetic reprogramming.

NewLimit believes that a new class of longevity medicines can improve the lives of everyone on the planet, even those not diagnosed with a classically defined disease.

For decades, medicine has treated disease after it manifests. NewLimit targets the underlying aging process itself before disease emerges.

Longevity isn't a niche market.

Everyone ages. Every cell accumulates damage over time.

Science is advancing faster than expected.

The capital is flowing to the right companies.

The clinical timelines are getting real.

NewLimit is proving that epigenetic reprogramming isn't science fiction, it's the next frontier of medicine.

Here's what I got into:

The stuff that gets me fired up! AI + robotics, aka: the next industrial revolution, space exploration, decentralization, how the best founders see opportunities in industries everyone else thinks are "finished".

David asked great questions about my investments in @Tesla, @SpaceX, @Coinbase, and @RobinhoodApp and what I'm looking for in 2025.

If you want to hear me talk about Bitcoin's most under-appreciated use case, why Gen Z is going to change everything, and that time Elon... well, you'll have to listen for that one.

> Huawei announced Flex:ai container software today. The tool slices GPU/NPU cards into virtual units at 10% precision and pools idle resources across clusters. Huawei claims utilization increases from 30-40% to 70%. The software will be open sourced on Magic Engine community.

The utilization numbers need validation in production environments. Software layer optimization is standard practice across the industry.

The timing matters more than the technology. Chinese AI companies face compute constraints as advanced chip access tightens. Flex:ai addresses scarcity through efficiency rather than expansion. This reflects broader infrastructure challenges in China’s AI sector.

Open sourcing signals ecosystem ambition. Huawei positions itself at the orchestration layer where resource decisions happen. The play is adoption and influence. Chinese tech giants run their own scheduling systems. Huawei needs traction beyond press coverage.

> Analysts are now talking about $50 billion in TSMC capex next year, however, even assuming a pretty conservative capex-to-revenues ratio of 37% already results in $54 billion. If by '27, capex would revert to TSMC's long term average of 39% capex to revenues, we'd be at $68 billion. The risk-reward for semicap is clearly to the upside with the market continuing to assume very conservative capex assumptions for TSMC. This is not what has happened historically during semi booms. Additionally, HBM is very capex intensive, which gives strong upside in capex requirements for the Memory space.

> Look at the price action since the AI jitters on 11/10, the market is clearly assigning a “stability premium” to the names with the biggest contracted HPC bases, not the best risk–reward.

$CORZ – 590 MW contracted and fast-to-scale BTC shells, so it trades like the safest.
$WULF – 594 MW contracted on real zero-carbon power, so it gets treated as stable.
$CIFR – 600 MW contracted, but ERCOT buildout risk keeps it in the middle.
$APLD – 600 MW contracted but with execution/infra dependencies, so it stays discounted.
$IREN – 310 MW contracted and multi-year hyperscale builds, so slower to re-rate.
$WYFI – only 16 MW contracted today, so it gets punished the most…but has the most torque if even one large HPC deal lands.

Same sector, completely different convexity profiles.

> Interesting pattern in AI this year: the giants are waking up.

In China, it’s Alibaba and ByteDance. In the US, it’s Google.

These companies have capital to train powerful models. Google’s Gemini 2.5 joined the top tier. Alibaba’s Qwen 3 leads in open source. ByteDance’s Doubao keeps improving.

They have distribution. ByteDance pushes Doubao through Douyin and Toutiao. Google can embed Gemini across Gmail, Search, and Chrome. Acquisition costs are minimal.

They have cloud platforms. AI models become the new storefront for their cloud businesses. Gemini helps Google Cloud tell an AI story. Doubao makes Volcano Engine a real challenger to Alibaba Cloud in China.

This isn’t bad news for startups. It proves the market is massive and still evolving.

Some focus on vertical models. Others build AI operating systems. Some embed LLMs deep into industry workflows. Even Oracle found new growth by building datacenters and cloud infrastructure.

When old players can still make comebacks, the game is far from over.

> Robin Li published an essay in People’s Daily calling for Chinese enterprises to “internalize AI capabilities” and build “AI-native” systems. The piece emphasizes real-world deployment over model benchmarks.

This aligns perfectly with what I observed at Baidu World 2025. While Western AI companies chase frontier models, China is building optimization engines that run inside traffic grids, power systems and financial networks. Baidu’s Famou platform adjusts signal timing in real time. Its Kunlun supernodes turn thousands of domestic chips into coherent compute islands. Apollo Go has logged 17 million robotaxi rides across 22 cities.

The systems-first approach reflects China’s industrial structure and regulatory environment. AI must work inside physical infrastructure at population scale. This creates different priorities than Silicon Valley’s.

Token consumption hit trillions daily. Q3 saw 2,000+ government AI contracts. Pricing shifted from discounts to workflow economics.

This isn’t experimentation anymore. Models are embedded in continuous operations. Government systems. Enterprise workflows. Developer pipelines. Usage that compounds, not spikes.

Sustained usage builds something more valuable than benchmarks. Real task data. Switching costs. Economic moats.

The question isn’t who has the best model. It’s who has the deepest usage foundation.
